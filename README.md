## Usage

### <h2>Class: `Plotting`</h2>

The Plotting class provides functionalities for visualizing categorical and numerical data in a pandas DataFrame, as well as comparing the performance of different algorithms using bar charts.

**Initialization**:

```python
Plotting(df)
```

#### `draw_categorical_plots()`

**Description**:

This method identifies all categorical columns in the DataFrame and generates count plots for each column. The plots are arranged in a grid layout with a specified number of columns per row.

**Parameters**:

- `n_cols (int)`: Number of columns per row in the plot grid. Default is 3.

**Returns**:

- `None`: This method displays the plot directly.

**Example Usage**:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
plotter = Plotting(df)
plotter.draw_categorical_plots(n_cols=3)
```

---

#### `draw_numerical_plots()`

**Description**:

This method identifies all numerical columns in the DataFrame and generates histograms for each column. The plots are arranged in a grid layout with a specified number of columns per row.

**Parameters**:

- `n_cols (int)`: Number of columns per row in the plot grid. Default is 3.

**Returns**:

- `None`: This method displays the plot directly.

**Example Usage**:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
plotter = Plotting(df)
plotter.draw_numerical_plots(n_cols=3)
```

---

#### `plot_algorithm_comparison()`

**Description**:

This method generates a bar chart comparing the performance of different algorithms based on various scores. Each algorithm is represented by a different color, and the scores are displayed as bars.

**Parameters**:

- `algorithm_scores (dict)`: A dictionary where keys are algorithm names and values are dictionaries containing score names as keys and scores as values.
- `bar_width (float)`: Width of the bars in the plot. Default is 0.2.

**Returns**:

- `None`: This method displays the plot directly.

**Example Usage**:

```python
scores = {
    'Algorithm1': {'Accuracy': 0.95, 'Precision': 0.90, 'Recall': 0.92},
    'Algorithm2': {'Accuracy': 0.93, 'Precision': 0.88, 'Recall': 0.91}
}
plotter = Plotting(df)
plotter.plot_algorithm_comparison(scores, bar_width=0.2)
```

---

### <h2>Class: `MachineLearning`</h2>

The MachineLearning class provides functionalities for feature selection, model evaluation, and visualization of model performance using scikit-learn models.

**Initialization**:

```python
MachineLearning()
```

#### `select_best_features()`

**Description**:

This method iteratively applies a feature selection strategy to the dataset, fits the specified machine learning model, and evaluates its performance. It tracks performance metrics for each number of features used and identifies the optimal number of features that yield the best performance score. Additionally, it returns the names of the best features along with the fitted feature selector for the best model.

**Parameters**:

- `X (pd.DataFrame)`: The input features DataFrame.
- `y (pd.Series)`: The target variable Series.
- `model (sklearn estimator)`: An instance of a scikit-learn regression or classification model.
- `feature_selector (function)`: A function that returns a feature selector object from scikit-learn (e.g., SelectKBest). The object must have `fit_transform` and `get_support` methods.

**Returns**:

- `int`: The optimal number of features yielding the best performance score.
- `pd.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the performance metrics for each number of features.
- `list`: The names of the best features selected by the feature selection method.
- `selector`: The fitted feature selector object for the best model.

**Example Usage**:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression

ml = MachineLearning()
model = LinearRegression()
feature_selector = lambda k: SelectKBest(f_regression, k=k)
best_features, results, best_feature_names, best_selector = ml.select_best_features(X, y, model, feature_selector)
print("Best number of features:", best_features)
print("Best features:", best_feature_names)

```

---

#### `plot_accuracy_vs_features()`

**Description**:

This method should be run after the `select_best_features` method. It uses the results from `select_best_features` to create the plot. The method automatically detects the model type (classification or regression) based on the metrics available in the results and plots the relevant metric.

**Parameters**:

- `save_path (str, optional)`: Absolute path to save the plot. If None, the plot is not saved to a file.

**Returns**:

- `None`: This method displays the plot directly.

**Example Usage**:

```python
ml = MachineLearning()
ml.plot_accuracy_vs_features(save_path='/absolute/path/to/save/plot.png')

```

---

#### `evaluate_model()`

**Description**:

This method evaluates the given model over multiple train-test splits and computes average performance metrics, which are different for classifiers and regressors. It returns the metrics recorded for each iteration, the average performance metrics, and the model fitted in the last iteration.

**Parameters**:

- `X (pd.DataFrame)`: The input features DataFrame.
- `y (pd.Series)`: The target variable Series.
- `test_size (float)`: The proportion of the dataset to include in the test split.
- `iterations_number (int)`: The number of iterations to repeat the train-test split and evaluation.
- `model (sklearn estimator)`: An instance of a scikit-learn regression or classification model.

**Returns**:

- `pd.DataFrame`: DataFrame containing the metrics recorded for each iteration.
- `dict`: Average performance metrics over all iterations, rounded to three decimal places.
- `model`: The model fitted in the last iteration.

**Example Usage**:

```python
ml = MachineLearning()
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
model = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=3)  # or any classifier
iteration_metrics, average_metrics, final_model = ml.evaluate_model(X, y, 0.3, 30, model)
print(average_metrics)

```

---

#### `plot_iteration_metrics()`

**Description**:

This method plots boxplots for the metrics recorded in each iteration by the `evaluate_model` method. It requires that `evaluate_model` has been run beforehand to generate iteration metrics.

**Returns**:

- `None`: This method displays the plot directly.

**Example Usage**:

```python
ml = MachineLearning()
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
model = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=3)
_, _, iteration_metrics = ml.evaluate_model(X, y, 0.3, 30, model)
ml.plot_iteration_metrics()

```

---

### <h2>Class: `DatasetInformation`</h2>

The DatasetInformation class provides functionalities for summarizing and visualizing various aspects of a pandas DataFrame.

**Initialization**:

```python
DatasetInformation(df)
```

**Parameters**:

- `df (pandas.DataFrame)`: The DataFrame to be summarized.

#### `dataframe_summary()`

**Description**:

This method provides a detailed summary of the DataFrame, including the shape, column data types, count of null values, and duplicated rows. If column metadata is provided, it is included in the summary.

**Parameters**:

- `col_metadata (dict, optional)`: A dictionary with column names as keys and their descriptions as values. If provided, these descriptions are included in the summary.

**Returns**:

- `None`: This method displays the summary directly.

**Example Usage**:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
col_metadata = {
    'column1': 'Description for column1',
    'column2': 'Description for column2',
    # ... other columns
}
info = DatasetInformation(df)
info.dataframe_summary(col_metadata)

```

---

#### `categorical_summary()`

**Description**:

This method summarizes categorical columns in the DataFrame, showing the number of unique values, the most frequent value, and its percentage for each column. For columns with fewer than 20 unique values, it also displays a detailed list of unique values and their distributions.

**Returns**:

- `None`: This method displays the summary directly.

**Example Usage**:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
info = DatasetInformation(df)
info.categorical_summary()
```

---

#### `numerical_summary()`

**Description**:

This method summarizes numerical columns in the DataFrame by providing statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, range, minimum, and maximum for each column. It also displays a correlation matrix and a heatmap of the correlations.

**Returns**:

- `None`: This method displays the summary directly.

**Example Usage**:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
info = DatasetInformation(df)
